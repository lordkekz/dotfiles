# Welcome to my personal dotfiles!

In this repo, I manage my dotfiles (program configurations) and such using [nix](https://nixos.org), nix-flakes and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

You can see some things about this flake using these commands:

- `nix flake metadata github:lordkekz/dotfiles` (Shows info and inputs)
- `nix flake show github:lordkekz/dotfiles` (Shows some outputs)
- `nix search github:lordkekz/dotfiles` (Lists provided packages)
